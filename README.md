# CompaDecimal

CompaDecimal is a Rust library (crate) that introduces a new decimal system designed to represent large numbers using a compact character set. By combining numbers, letters, and symbols, CompaDecimal allows for high-value numbers to be represented in a smaller number of characters, making it efficient for storage and transmission.

This library is open-source and welcomes contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community. An extended version of this crate is planned, which will include support for arbitrarily large numbers using BigUint.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of CompaDecimal is to create a compact and efficient decimal system that:

- Represents large numbers in fewer characters by utilizing a custom character set.
- Supports multiple numeric types, including unsigned integers (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128).
- Provides conversion utilities between standard decimal numbers and the CompaDecimal format.
- Ensures extensibility for future support of BigUint for arbitrarily large numbers.

## Features

### 1. Custom Character Set

CompaDecimal uses a custom character set that includes:
- Numbers
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Special characters

This character set allows for a base-95 numeral system, enabling compact representation of large numbers.

### 2. Core Functions

The library provides the following core functions:

#### `decimal_to_compa<T>(num: T) -> String`
- Converts a standard decimal number into a CompaDecimal string.
- Supports unsigned integer types (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128).
- Example:
  ```rust
  let num: u32 = 12345;
  let compa = decimal_to_compa(num);
  println!("CompaDecimal: {}", compa);
  ```

#### `compa_to_decimal<T>(compa: &str) -> Result<T, CompaDecimalError>`
- Converts a CompaDecimal string back into a standard decimal number.
- Supports unsigned integer types (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128).
- Example:
  ```rust
  let compa = "A1";
  let decimal: u32 = compa_to_decimal(compa).unwrap();
  println!("Decimal: {}", decimal);
  ```

#### `add_one(current: String) -> Result<String, Error>`
- Increments a CompaDecimal string by one.
- Example:
  ```rust
  let current = "A1".to_string();
  let incremented = add_one(current).unwrap();
  println!("Incremented CompaDecimal: {}", incremented);
  ```

#### `get_next(current: char) -> Result<char, Error>`
- Retrieves the next character in the CompaDecimal character set.
- Example: [Example code here]

### CompaDecimal Struct

A struct that encapsulates a CompaDecimal value and provides methods for conversion and manipulation.
- Example: [Example code here]

## Planned Features

An extended version of this crate is in development, which will include:
- Support for BigUint: Allowing representation and manipulation of arbitrarily large numbers.
- Additional utilities for advanced operations on CompaDecimal values.

## Installation

Add the following to your Cargo.toml to include CompaDecimal in your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
compadecimal = "0.1.0"
```

Then, import the crate in your Rust code:

```rust
use compadecimal::*;
```
