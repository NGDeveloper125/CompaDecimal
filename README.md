# CompaDecimal

CompaDecimal is a Rust library (crate) that introduces a new decimal system designed to represent large numbers using a compact character set. By combining numbers, letters, and symbols, CompaDecimal allows for high-value numbers to be represented in a smaller number of characters, making it efficient for storage and transmission.

This library is open-source and welcomes contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community. An extended version of this crate is planned, which will include support for arbitrarily large numbers using `BigUint`.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of CompaDecimal is to create a compact and efficient decimal system that:
- **Represents large numbers in fewer characters** by utilizing a custom character set.
- **Supports multiple numeric types**, including unsigned integers (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`).
- **Provides conversion utilities** between standard decimal numbers and the CompaDecimal format.
- **Ensures extensibility** for future support of `BigUint` for arbitrarily large numbers.

## Features

### 1. Custom Character Set

CompaDecimal uses a custom character set that includes:
- Numbers
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Special characters

This character set allows for a base-95 numeral system, enabling compact representation of large numbers.

### 2. Core Functions

The library provides the following core functions:

#### `CompaDecimal::decimal_to_compa<T>(num: T) -> Result<CompaDecimal, CompaDecimalError>`
- Converts a standard decimal number into a `CompaDecimal` value.
- Supports unsigned integer types (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`).
- **Example**:
  ```rust
  let compa = CompaDecimal::decimal_to_compa(123456789u64).unwrap();
  println!("CompaDecimal: {}", compa.to_string()); // Output: "1LY7VK"
  ```

 #### `to_decimal<T>(&self) -> Result<T, CompaDecimalError>`
- Converts a CompaDecimal value back into a standard decimal number.
- Supports unsigned integer types (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128).
```rust
let compa = CompaDecimal::new("1LY7VK".to_string());
let decimal: u64 = compa.to_decimal().unwrap();
println!("Decimal: {}", decimal); // Output: 123456789
```

#### `increase_by<T>(&self, amount: T) -> Result<CompaDecimal, CompaDecimalError>`
- Increases the CompaDecimal value by a specified amount.
- Supports unsigned integer types (u8, u16, u32, u64, u128).
```rust
let compa = CompaDecimal::from("1LY7VK").unwrap();
let increased = compa.increase_by::<u32>(1234).unwrap();
println!(increased.value, "1LY7$Q");
```

#### `len(&self) -> usize`
- Returns the length of the CompaDecimal value.
```rust
let compa = CompaDecimal::from("1LY7VK").unwrap();
assert_eq(compa.len(), 6);
```

#### `add_one(&mut self)`
- Increments the CompaDecimal value by one.
```rust
let mut compa = CompaDecimal::new("A1".to_string());
compa.plus_one();
assert_eq(compa.value, "A2");
```

#### `add(&self, additional_value: &str) -> CompaDecimal`
- Add the additional value to the CompaDecimal value.
```rust
let compa = CompaDecimal::new();
let new_compa = compa.add("as1Ad4");
assert_eq(new_compa.value, "as1Ad4");
```


## Planned Features

An extended version of this crate is in development, which will include:
- Support for BigUint: Allowing representation and manipulation of arbitrarily large numbers.
- Additional utilities for advanced operations on CompaDecimal values.

## Installation

Add the following to your Cargo.toml to include CompaDecimal in your project:

```toml
[dependencies]
compadecimal = "0.1.0"
```

Then, import the crate in your Rust code:

```rust
use compadecimal::*;
```
